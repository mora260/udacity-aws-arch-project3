1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.

We can put the instance in a private subnet, with no direct access from the internet. This will minimize internet-facing attack surface.
Only resources in VPC with the right security groups and NACL will be able to communicate with the instance.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, without changing the IAM permissions in the role, even when creating a VPC private endpoint to S3, will not secure the bucket.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. Data written to the bucket previous to the default encryption enable event will be kept unencrypted. Nonetheless, reading and 
rewriting the same objects back to the bucket, will encrypt them.

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

If no modifications are made to the commands, we will get an AlreadyExistsException, since the especified stack already exists.
If changing the command to a different stack name, it will start but soon a rollback will be performed because some of the exported
names from the resources collide.

For the scripts to run appropriately again and get a new configuration (completely new resources), naming conventions should be applyed.
Or previous stacks should be removed.

To update the configuration of the cloudformation a drift detection must be made. Importing policies should be established as retain
for the resources that must be maintained. Unused parameters and outputs should be updated accordingly.

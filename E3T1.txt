1. What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?

GuardDuty findings of the attack:

Finding type: UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce

----------
High
i-06f309bfcbb9c4532 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.38.

3. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. 
what was its source of information?

GuardDuty can use the followings as data sources:

- AWS CloudTrail Event Logs
- AWS CloudTrail Management Events
- AWS CloudTrail S3 Data Events
- VPC Flow Logs
- DNS logs

In this case, VPC Flow Logs were used to spot connections to the default SSH port (Port 22).

Important notes in the documentation:
This finding is generated only through monitoring traffic on port 22.
If your SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated.

So this finding is only usefull for the default ssh port. If my instance uses another port for SSH connections, this is not triggered.

The severity was HIGH because one of my EC2 instances was issued to perform the attack.

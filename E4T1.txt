# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Move the Application EC2 instance to a private subnet
2. Enable specific port rules in the Network Access Control List
3. VPC default ingress and egress traffic is completely restricted, with few exceptions to guarantee operation of the application.
4. Only allow connections to the instance from a trusted security group and trusted private IP range.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

2. We can:
  a. Limit the role permissions to only have read access to the specific wanted bucket (free recipes) instead of all S3 permissions
  over all the S3 resources
  b. Use server side encryption with specific managed AWS KMS keys in the secret bucket
  So that even with overpermissive policies, only roles that have the right usage permissions to the key can access the bucket

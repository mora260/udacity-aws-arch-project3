# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

- checkov
- Regula: open policy agent
- Terrascan (Accurics)
- TFLint

### Example vulnerability

- S3 not having encryption, versioning, access logging or public access configurations
- EC2 instances vulnerable ports
- RDS instances in inappropiate subnets (public)
- Hardcoded api keys
- Enforce best practices: naming conventions, syntax, find errors (for example illegal instance names),
  deprecated syntax, unused declarations, etc.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

- Clair
- Aqua Security
- Anchore
- Falco
- Docker Bench
- Docker Scan

### Example vulnerability

- Indexing, matching and notifying about OS vulnerabilities (clair):
  for example in debian 9:
    {
      "Name":"CVE-2018-6954",
      "NamespaceName":"debian:9",
      "Description":"systemd-tmpfiles in systemd through 237 mishandles symlinks present in non-terminal path components, which allows local users to obtain ownership of arbitrary files via vectors involving creation of a directory and a file under that directory, and later replacing that directory with a symlink. This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks sysctl is turned on.",
      "Link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6954",
      "Severity":"High"
    }
- Identify vulnerabilities by image layer: outdated libraries with exploits can be detected and updated before the usage of an image
- Check for container image authenticity

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- AWS Config
- AWS Inspector
- AWS Security Hub
- Prowler
- Cloudspoit
- Fugue

### Example vulnerability

- Overpermissive policies
- S3 encryption disabled, no versioning, no logging
- Cloudtrail not in all regions, not alarms
- EC2 instances with exposed ports or in public subnets
- EC2 instances permitting SSH over the internet
- EBS not encrypted
- RDS instances outside of private subnets
- Multifactor authentication not enabled
